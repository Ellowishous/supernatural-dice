    const paths = {
      "1-1-1": "Within the peeling walls of the asylum, you form the sigil and whisper the name. The spirit answers- its voice a rasp of forgotten sorrow. You leave untouched... but at night, shadows now linger too long.",
      "1-1-2": "The summoning circle flickers, unstable. The spirit screams through the veil, its wrath shattering your protection. A chill rushes outward- and the curse seeps into the world.",
      "1-1-3": "You chant the incantation, and the walls begin to breathe. A hand made of mist reaches out and touches your arm. Your name, your body- gone, as if you never existed.",
      "1-1-4": "The spirit arrives in a flash of icy wind, its face eerily familiar. It grants you what you sought- secrets, knowledge... or revenge. But each night, you bleed a little more, from nowhere at all.",
      "1-1-5": "The ritual is too powerful. The veil tears. Spirits pour through, wailing with joy - and fury. The asylum becomes a beacon, pulsing with otherworldly presence. You are no longer in control.",
      "1-1-6": "You bolt upright in your bed, the chanting still ringing in your ears. Your hands smell faintly of sulfur, your skin is colder than the room. But the asylum insn't real... is it?",
      "1-2-1": "The spirit answers in broken whispers, eyes glowing where its mouth should be. You learn what you came for - but in the silence that follows, footsteps echo behind you for days.",
      "1-2-2": "You call out to the dead, but your words are warped. Instead of one voice, dozens respond. The asylum's long-dead patients awaken, and their pain crawls into the living world.",
      "1-2-3": "The voice you hear speaks your name backwards. Then it speaks it again - and it no longer sounds familiar. No one remembers you. Not even the mirror.",
      "1-2-4": "The dead speak, and they demand something in return. You walk away with knowledge - and a dead man's scream stitched into your spine that you never stop hearing.",
      "1-2-5": "The dead don't wait for an invitation. The walls groan, rooms shift, and spirits begin to speak through your mouth. You're just one voice among many now.",
      "1-2-6": "You sit up in a hospital bed. Clean. White. Silent. But deep inside, something feels different. You remember everything - but no one believes you.",
      "1-3-1": "You find it beneath a cracked floor tile - a strange talisman pulsing faintly. But from that moment on, reflections seem wrong, and your shadow sometimes moves before you do.",
      "1-3-2": "You dig through the rubble, fingertips bleeding, but the relic was already moved - or awakened. Now the asylum's halls breathe, and its madness creeps into the town beyond.",
      "1-3-3": "The relic is in your hand - briefly. The light bends, time folds, and you're gone. Even in old records, your name is scratched out like it never belonged.",
      "1-3-4": "You find the relic tucked in the children's ward, humming with power. But you feel yourself aging by the hour. Your reflection sags. The price has been taken.",
      "1-3-5": "You touch the relic and everything shifts. The asylum awakens. Shadows move independently and the veil lifts- for good. You've crowned the relic's return.",
      "1-3-6": "You wake with something clenched in your hand - a rusted piece of metal, oddly warm. You don't remember how you got home. But you can't stop dreaming of the asylum.",
      "1-4-1": "You stand your ground as the phantom materializes, its face a blur of grief and rage. You endure its scream, and it dissolves-defeated. But ever since, you swear you see your breath in warm air.",
      "1-4-2": "The phantom passes through you, leaving frost where skin should be. Its hatred was never meant to end here. Now it wears your shape and walks the world beyond the asylum.",
      "1-4-3": "You raise your hand in defense, but the phantom's touch consumes. It pulls you into a space between seconds. Now you linger where screams never echo-and no one remembers you ever screamed.",
      "1-4-4": "You burn incense, chant, resist the phantom's lure. You survive, but your hair turns white, your voice never returns. The phantom is gone-but so is a piece of you.",
      "1-4-5": "You try to resist, but your fear is its entry point. The phantom expands- filling the asylum, then beyond. Windows crack. People speak backwards. The world tilts.",
      "1-4-6": "You jolt awake in a chair, breath ragged. The room is still. Empty. But there's frost on the floor, and your breath still fogs. Dreams don't usually leave eviddence.",
      "1-5-1": "With the final incantation, the curse uncoils like smoke from stone. The room grows still. But as you leave, a cold breath clings to your meck. You are no longer walking alone.",
      "1-5-2": "You speak the words, but the markings distort under your gaze. The curse roars outward, infectimg the floor, the walls, the sky beyond the windows. It no llonger belongs to just this placce.",
      "1-5-3": "The curse wraps around you like a shroud. Your last thought is of freedom - but even that dissolves. Your name is erased from documents, photos, memories. You never were.",
      "1-5-4": "The chains of the curse snap, and light floods the room. But every year on this day, blood seeps from your eyes. Your freedom was traded for something unseen, and it waits.",
      "1-5-5": "You break the curse - but in doing so, free what was imprisoned within it. Spirits bloom across the asylum like flowers from rot. Their song is beautiful... and inescapable.",
      "1-5-6": "You wake in your room, clean and quiet.But the mirror cracks when you pass, and a mark glows faintly on your chest. Maybe it was a dream- but you brought something back with you.",
      "1-6-1": "You map the grounds carefully, noting symbols carved into trees and walls. You return with your findings - and yet in every photograph, there's a shape behind you. It gets closer each day.",
      "1-6-2": "The land rejects your presence. You fall through rotten boards, into chambers meant to stay sealed. The air changes - and something ancient stirs. The roots of the curse dig deep and wide.",
      "1-6-3": "You follow footprints that loop endlessly until they fade mid-step. Later, no one recallsyour visit. The asylum's grounds remain undisturbed- as though you never walked them at all.",
      "1-6-4": "You find the old patient ledger buried near a willow tree. But the names inside now whisper in your mind. They won't let you forget them- not even in sleep.",
      "1-6-5": "Your exploration opens forgotten paths- corridrs that weren't there before. The asylum begins to grow. Trees bleed, shadows walk upright. You've awakened its memory, and now it remembers everything.",
      "1-6-6": "You wake in your car outside the asylum, headlights still on. No photos on your phone. No dirt on your shoes. But your voice is hoarse, as if you'd been screaming for hours.",
